# Hi there.
This is a basic boiler plate using nodejs, express, mongoDB, mongoose. 
I'm not good enough, but I hope you use it well.
This is code for server developers, so for client developers, you can set it according to the language used in the client folder.

# To use this application, 
1. type "npm install" inside "server" folder 
2. make .env file in server folder and put your
  "DATABASE_URI" : mongoDB connect url
  "ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET" : secret key for accessToken
  "REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET" : secret key for refreshToken
3. use any client model in the client folder
4. enjoy your project

# Notice
If there is an error or a better correction, please tell me. i will fix it.

Thank you.
